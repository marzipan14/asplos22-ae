This repository contains the artifacts, including experiments and graphs, for
the paper:

### FlexOS: Towards Flexible OS Isolation

 > **Abstract**:  At design time, modern operating systems are locked in a
> specific safety and isolation strategy that mixes one or more
> hardware/software protection mechanisms (e.g. user/kernel separation);
> revisiting these choices after deployment requires a major refactoring effort.
> This rigid approach shows its limits given the wide variety of modern
> applications' safety/performance requirements, when new hardware isolation
> mechanisms are rolled out, or when existing ones break.
> 
> We present FlexOS, a novel OS allowing users to easily specialize the
> safety and isolation strategy of an OS at compilation/deployment time
> instead of design time. This modular LibOS is composed of fine-grained
> components that can be isolated via a range of hardware protection mechanisms
> with various data sharing strategies and additional software hardening. The
> OS ships with an exploration technique helping the user navigate the vast
> safety/performance design space it unlocks. We implement a prototype of the
> system and demonstrate, for several applications (Redis/Nginx/SQLite),
> FlexOS’ vast configuration space as well as the efficiency of the
> exploration technique: we evaluate 80 FlexOS configurations for Redis and
> show how that space can be probabilistically subset to the 5 safest ones under
> a given performance budget. We also show that, under equivalent
> configurations, FlexOS performs similarly or better than several
> baselines/competitors.

## 1. Experiments

The paper comes with 11 figures and 1 tables worth of experiments (although not
all of them have experimental results, e.g.,  Figure 2 is an architecture
diagram).  Each experiment and the relevant scripts to generate the data and
subsequent plots are included in this repository.  We expect the results
generated from this artifact to match one-to-one with the results in the paper,
given that we used this artifact/scripts to actually generate all figures in the
paper.

Each figure, table, and corresponding experiment are listed below. *Estimated
preparation time* indicates the amount of time needed to execute `make prepare`
for this experiment. *Estimated run time* indicated the amount of time needed
to execute `make run` for this experiment. Unless explicitely stated in the
column, these tasks are *fully automated* and do not require any form of human
interaction.

## 2. Repository structure

We have organised this repository as follows:

 * `experiments/` - All experiments are listed in this directory.  Each
   sub-directory is named with the figure number along with a short description
   of the experiment (e.g., `fig-06_nginx-redis-perm`).  In addition, each
   experiment sub-directory has a corresponding `README.md` which explains in
   more detail how the experiment works and how to run it.  Along with this,
   each sub-directory also comes with a `Makefile` with the following targets:
    - `prepare`: prepares the experiment, by usually downloading and building
      relevant images, tools, and auxiliary services necessary for running the
      experiment.
    - `run`: runs the experiment.
    - `plot`: produces the figure or table.  All plots are automatically saved
      into the [`plots/`](/plots) directory.
    - `clean`: removes intermediate build files.
 * `plots/` - Contains all resulting figures seen in the paper.

## 3. Prerequisites

Before you can run these experiments, you will need to prepare a physical host
environment.  Access to the physical host environment is important as it is
required to run Virtual Machine (VM) images.

Many of these benchmarks are highly latency-sensitive, and a change in a few
cycles might create significant discrepancies with the paper's results. Although
not strictly necessary, we therefore recommend a careful setup of the system to
reproduce the results. Section 3.2 gives advice on this matter.

### 3.1. Hardware & Software Dependencies

| Hardware | Minimal requirements                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| CPU      | Intel® Xeon® Scalable, > Skylake, > 8 cores |
| RAM      | >= 128GB                                    |
| Disk     | >= 100 GB (of free space)                   |

All our results were run on an Intel® Xeon® Silver 4114, but this artifact may
be run with any processor that supports Intel MPK, typically any Intel® Xeon®
Scalable Processor starting with the Skylake generation. In this case, however,
the results might differ from the paper.  Ideally, the processor should have
more than 8 cores.

Our machine has 128.0 GB RAM. We do not recommend running this artifact on a
machine with less RAM given the high memory requirements of Wayfinder for
Figure 6.

On the disk side, we recommend > 100.0 GB of free space to be on the safe side;
this is roughly equivalent to 60 GB for Figure 6, and 10 GB for each of Figures
9-11, and Table 1.

Note that these are *not* the minimal requirements to run FlexOS, they are only
necessary to reproduce the paper's results.

| Software | Requirements                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------- |
| Debian   | 11.1 (host), 10 (Docker guests) |
| Linux    | `5.10.70-1`                     |
| Docker   | `20.10.10`                      |

On the software side, this artifact was tested on Debian 11.1 and Linux version
`5.10.70-1`.  However, we expect that it should run on many more recent or
slightly older Debian releases. All docker guests use Debian 10; this is a hard
requirement.

### 3.2. Isolation of Cores

This artifact may use up to 7 cores for experiments: four non-isolated cores
(so that the kernel's load balancer can be used), and three isolated cores (via
`isolcpu`, see the Linux kernel
[documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt)).
If the machine only has 8 cores, the remaining system load (however minimal)
might not fit in the remaining core and create noise in experiments, so, as
mentioned in the previous section, we recommend a larger core count.

For each experiment, you should declare the cores that you want to use
(isolated and non-isolated), either by editing the `NOISOLED_CPUX` and
`ISOLED_CPUX` variables in each experiment's `Makefile`, or by exporting these
variables in the shell. The `Makefile`s should be fairly self-explanatory. In
the artifact evaluation testbed, we use core 1-4 as non-isolated
core, and core 5-7 as isolated cores.

Since these benchmarks are using non-isolated cores as well, it is important to
keep the noise level on them as minimal as possible, e.g., concurrently running
processes, other users, etc. We recommend the following:

- Ideally the machine should be a fresh installation to avoid any non-necessary
  deamon or process
- If the machine is shared (as is the case for the ASPLOS'22 AE setup), it is
  critical that the different users coordinate on the use of the physical
  machine

**Note for the ASPLOS AEC**: the test machine is already set up to fit the
default values of this artifact, you do not need to update these variables
unless you attempt to run this artifact on another setup.

### 3.3 Installing Docker

Many of the experiments use Docker as an intermediate tool for creating build
and test environments (along with testing Docker itself).  Please [install
Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your system to continue. This
artifact makes heavy use of Docker containers, and so we recommend you to use a
recent version of Docker to avoid storage pool issues.  See
[troubleshooting](#5-troubleshooting). Our version of Docker is `20.10.10`.

## 4. Getting started

1. Before running any of these experiments, prepare your host with the
   recommendations detailed above in [prerequisites](#3-prerequisites);

2. Clone the main AE repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/project-flexos/asplos22-ae.git
   ```

3. Generate a GitHub token ([instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token))
   and set it in the Makefiles. There are two approaches. Either you can set it
   for the entire system with
   ```bash
   export KRAFT_TOKEN="<your token>"
   ```
   or set it in every Makefile by editing the `KRAFT_TOKEN` variable
   ```bash
   ...
   #
   # Parameters
   #
   KRAFT_TOKEN ?= <your token>
   ...
   ```
   Note that if `KRAFT_TOKEN` is set system-wide, definitions in Makefiles will
   not override it.

4. Install dependencies with
   ```bash
   make dependencies
   ```

5. All experiments should be `prepare`d first, which installs necessary tools
   and downloads additional resources, before they can run.  This can be done
   for a single experiment, for example:
   ```bash
   make prepare-fig-07
   ```
   or for all experiments via:
   ```
   make prepare
   ```
6. Once one or many experiments have been prepared, they can be run, again using
   a similar syntax as above:
   ```bash
   make run-fig-07
   ```
   or for all experiments via:
   ```
   make run
   ```
   This will generate the relevant experimental results within the experimental
   folder of the specific experiment.
7. To plot one or many experiment's figures, use, for example:
   ```bash
   make plot-fig-07
   ```
   or for all experiments via:
   ```
   make plot
   ```
8. You can clean, or "properclean" to completely reset any preparation, with
   `make clean` or `make properclean` and for individual experiments, for
   example: 
   ```bash
   make clean-fig-07
   make properclean-fig-07
   ```
   or for all experiments via:
   ```
   make clean
   make properclean
   ```

**Note**: some experiments have a slightly different workflow. Figure 6 requires
you to set `HOST_CORES` with a set of cores to be used for the experiment.
Figure 8 is only a plot and requires some manual steps. Figure 11 requires a
reboot of the machine with different kernel parameters. Table 1 is manual. In
all of these cases, the local `README.md` provides appropriate explanations.

## 5. Troubleshooting

Note that each experiment folder (e.g., `experiments/fig-10_sqlite-exec-time/`)
has its own `README.md` and corresponding troubleshooting section. If you are
searching information regarding a particular experiment, take a look there as
well!

- **Problem**: Docker containers fail to build with errors indicating
  insufficient memory available.

  **Solution**: This artifact makes heavy use of Docker containers. Older
  versions of Docker are known to have issues with the maximum size of Docker
  containers or of the storage pool. Check the output of `docker info`. It should
  show `overlay2`. If it indicates `devicemapper`, your installation
  might be old or using the Debian/Ubuntu repositories. In this case, we recommend
  a fresh reinstall of Docker.

- **Problem**: `make prepare` fails for most experiments with this kind of error:
   ```bash
   Step 7/67 : RUN kraftcleanup
    ---> Running in b073220c85f5
   make: *** No rule to make target 'properclean'.  Stop.
   [CRITICAL] 401 {"message": "Bad credentials", "documentation_url": "https://docs.github.com/rest"}
   kraft caches are out-of-date. Would you like to update? [Y/n]: Aborted!
   The command '/bin/sh -c kraftcleanup' returned a non-zero code: 1
   make: *** [Makefile:36: prepare] Error 1
   ```

  **Solution**: You did not define the GitHub token variable (see [Getting Started](#4-getting-started)) or your
  GitHub token has become invalid (expired, revoked, etc.). You can check whether your GitHub
  token is valid with the following command:
   ```bash
   curl -v -H "Authorization: token <your token>" https://api.github.com/user/issues
   ```
  If it isn't, simply regenerate one. If it is, there might be a bug and you are welcome to open
  a bug report.

- **Problem**: Application X (e.g., Redis, or Nginx) crashes when I stress test
  it with tool Y or Z.

  **Solution**: As explained in the paper and in the main tree
  [`README.md`](https://github.com/project-flexos/unikraft/README.md), applications
  are ported manually and as such we cannot guarantee that this porting is complete
  for every possible execution path. Porting is not a contribution of this paper
  or proof-of-concept. Incomplete porting may result in false-positives, and crashes,
  when tested with other tools than the ones we used. In this case we recommend
  debugging the crash as explained in the documentation of the main tree to pinpoint the
  invalid access.

## 6. Zenodo Artifact & Tags

In addition to this repository, we have archived this artifact on
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/). In order to make the Zenodo artifact as
self-contained as possible, we included a copy of all public repositories of
the [`project-flexos` GitHub organization](https://github.com/project-flexos/)
under `repositories`. Note, however, that the `repositories` archive will not
be used by the benchmark script, which will still rely on online GitHub
repositories.  They are therefore provided for the sole purpose of archival.
You can generate a new organization snapshot with `make zenodo`.

We tagged each repository of the organization with `asplos22-ae` before
submission.

## 7. Beyond the Paper

This repository contains all scripts necessary to reproduce the experiments of
our ASPLOS'22 paper. It does not contain the FlexOS kernel, libraries, and
applications themselves. You can find all other repositories hosted under the
[same GitHub organization](https://github.com/project-flexos).
The FlexOS core kernel repository, in particular, lives in [this
repository](https://github.com/project-flexos/unikraft).  You can find
instructions on porting applications and building your own FlexOS images in the
core kernel repository's
[`README.md`](https://github.com/project-flexos/unikraft/blob/staging/README.md).

This artifact represents the stable part of FlexOS that we were able to release
for artifact evaluation as of December 2021. During this process, we became
aware of a number of bugs and issues that we patched on an ad-hoc basis, some
only in the form of patches in this repository. We are planning a second release
in a few months that will incorporate proper fixes for these issues, along with
an improved EPT backend.

## 8. Disclaimer

This artifact is the first release of a research proof-of-concept for flexible
OS isolation. Like any research prototype, it contains hacks, bugs, and TODOs. We
do not recommend using it in production, but wish that it will foster further
research!

## 9. Acknowledgements

This artifact would not exist without the hard work of the Unikraft community.
We encourage interested researchers to visit the project's [web
page](https://unikraft.org/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/unikraft/).
